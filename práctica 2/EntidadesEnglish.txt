The New IRA are capitalising on Brexit to recruit, senior members have admitted.

The Paramilitary group, who last week accepted responsibility for the killing of journalist Lyra McKee, said it would be "remiss" of them not to take advantage of the row over the Northern Irish border.

But in an interview with the Sunday Times, representatives admitted their campaign of violence had no chance of achieving their goal of a united Ireland.
They said: "The attacks are symbolic. They are propaganda. As long as you have the British in Ireland and the country remains partitioned, there will be an IRA."

One dissident told the Times: " Brexit has forced the IRA to refocus and has underlined how Ireland remains partitioned. It would be remiss of us not to capitalise on the opportunity"
